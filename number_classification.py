# Instructions:
# 1. Create a list of numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
# 2. Use a for loop to iterate through each number in the list.
# 3. Inside the loop, use an if-else statement to check if each number is even or odd.
# 4. Print "Number X is Even" if the number is even, or "Number X is Odd" if the number is odd.
# 5. Ensure that your program prints a message for each number in the list.
